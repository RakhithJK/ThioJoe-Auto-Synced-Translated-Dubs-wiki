### Priority Planned Features:
* N/A

### Other Planned Features:
* A "pronunciation fix" option that will allow user to set a list of words with custom phonetic pronunciations that will be fed to the the TTS service

### Features Maybe Eventually:
* Support for Amazon Polly

### Looking Into It
* Find a way to do 'forced alignment' of a good transcript with the video to get word-level timestamps, which should make it easier to start and stop speech clips at more natural breakpoints.
