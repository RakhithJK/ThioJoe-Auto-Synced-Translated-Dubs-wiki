### Priority Planned Features
* Option to use additional pauses between audio clips (Useful for SRT files that do not have any time gaps between lines)
* Option to do a "second pass" of voice synthesizing, where instead of the audio clips just being stretched, the program will send a second request to the TTS service for each clip, but this time setting the voice's speech rate equal to the stretch ratio, so it will be more natural.


### Features Maybe Eventually:
* Support for Amazon Polly
